    "# ## What is Hallucination? 🤔\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **Hallucination** মানে যখন AI model এমন কিছু generate করে যেটা:\n",
    "# - ❌ Factually incorrect (ভুল তথ্য)\n",
    "# - ❌ Doesn't exist (বানানো তথ্য)\n",
    "# - ❌ Not supported by input/context (context এ নেই)\n",
    "# - ❌ Logically inconsistent (contradictory)\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### Real-world Examples:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. **Factual Hallucination:**\n",
    "#    - Query: \"When did Einstein invent the telephone?\"\n",
    "#    - AI: \"Einstein invented the telephone in 1876\"\n",
    "#    - Reality: Einstein didn't invent the telephone, it was Alexander Graham Bell\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. **Source Hallucination:**\n",
    "#    - Query: \"What does the article say about climate change?\"\n",
    "#    - AI: \"The article mentions a 5-degree increase by 2030\"\n",
    "#    - Reality: Article doesn't mention this specific number\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. **Confidence Hallucination:**\n",
    "#    - AI gives completely wrong answer but with 100% confidence\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### কেন Hallucination হয়?\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. **Training Data Issues** - ভুল বা incomplete data\n",
    "# 2. **Model Limitations** - Model যেটা জানে না সেটা guess করে\n",
    "# 3. **Ambiguous Queries** - unclear প্রশ্ন\n",
    "# 4. **Context Missing** - পর্যাপ্ত context না থাকা\n",
    "# 5. **Over-confidence** - Model too confident in wrong answers\n",

    "# \n",
    "# ### 🎓 What We Learned:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. **Types of Hallucinations:**\n",
    "#    - Factual hallucinations\n",
    "#    - Source hallucinations\n",
    "#    - Confidence hallucinations\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. **Detection Methods:**\n",
    "#    - Source verification\n",
    "#    - Self-consistency checks\n",
    "#    - Attribution checking\n",
    "#    - Confidence calibration\n",
    "#    - Chain-of-thought verification\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. **Prevention Strategies:**\n",
    "#    - Use RAG with proper context\n",
    "#    - Implement multiple verification layers\n",
    "#    - Request confidence scores\n",
    "#    - Use self-consistency\n",
    "#    - Employ human-in-the-loop\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### 💡 Key Principles:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ✅ **Always provide context** - Don't let the model guess\n",
    "# ✅ **Verify against sources** - Check if answer is grounded\n",
    "# ✅ **Use multiple checks** - Combine different methods\n",
    "# ✅ **Request confidence** - Know when to trust the answer\n",
    "# ✅ **Human review for critical** - Don't automate everything\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### 🚫 Never Do:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ❌ Trust LLM output blindly for critical applications\n",
    "# ❌ Use LLMs without context for factual questions\n",
    "# ❌ Ignore low confidence scores\n",
    "# ❌ Skip verification steps to save time\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### 🎯 When to Use What:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# | Use Case | Best Method |\n",
    "# |----------|-------------|\n",
    "# | Factual Q&A | RAG + Attribution |\n",
    "# | Creative Writing | Self-Consistency |\n",
