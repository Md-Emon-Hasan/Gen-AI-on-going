      "1. Question: Who invented the telephone?\n",
      "   Answer: **Alexander Graham Bell** is widely credited with inventing the telephone and was granted the first U.S. patent for it on **March 7, 1876**.\n",
      "\n",
      "His famous first words spoken over the device were to his assistant, Thomas A. Watson, on March 10, 1876: \"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the invention of the telephone is a complex story with several other individuals who were working on similar technologies around the same time and whose contributions are also recognized:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Antonio Meucci:** An Italian immigrant who demonstrated a voice communication apparatus in New York in 1860 and filed a caveat (an intention to patent) in 1871, but couldn't afford to renew it. His work was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002.\n",
      "*   **Elisha Gray:** An American electrical engineer who filed a patent caveat for a telephone design on the very same day Bell filed his patent application (February 14, 1876). There was significant legal dispute over who was first.\n",
      "*   **Johann Philipp Reis:** A German scientist and inventor who built an early device in 1861 that could transmit musical tones and, to some extent, human speech, though it wasn't fully practical for intelligible conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these other contributions, Bell's patent and subsequent successful commercialization and development of the telephone solidified his place as its primary inventor in history.\n",

      "However, it's worth noting that the war in Europe had ended earlier, on **May 8, 1945 (V-E Day)**, following Germany's unconditional surrender.\n",
