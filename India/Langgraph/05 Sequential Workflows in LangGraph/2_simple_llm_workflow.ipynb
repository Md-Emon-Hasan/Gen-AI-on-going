      "['Excellent question! The answer is a bit more interesting than a single number, because the distance is constantly changing.\\n\\nHere’s the breakdown, from the simple answer to the more detailed explanation.\\n\\n### The Quick Answer\\n\\nThe average distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Moon is **about 384,400 kilometers (238,900 miles)**.\\n\\nThis is the number most people use and is a great general-knowledge fact.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The More Detailed Answer: An Elliptical Orbit\\n\\nThe Moon doesn\\'t orbit the Earth in a perfect circle; it travels in an ellipse (a slight oval). This means its distance from Earth varies throughout its orbit.\\n\\n*   **Perigee (Closest Point):** When the Moon is at its closest point to Earth, it is about **363,300 km (225,700 miles)** away. A full moon at perigee is often called a **\"Supermoon\"** because it can appear about 14% larger and 30% brighter than at its farthest point.\\n\\n*   **Apogee (Farthest Point):** When the Moon is at its farthest point from Earth, it is about **405,500 km (252,000 miles)** away.
